/**
 * An IASTFragment represents 'part' of an AST, but
 * not necessarily a subtree of the AST.  A fragment
 * may simply be an instance of some sort of pattern
 * or formation in an AST.
 * Such "fragments", however, do correspond to a
 * contiguous source code region, and, thus, posses a
 * source start position, and a source length.  Every
 * fragment maps to an ASTNode, although this mapping is
 * not necessarily straightforward, and more than one
 * fragment may map to a given node.
 *
 * Fragments support abstract operations, which
 * support the notion of 'matching' fragments.
 * One operation determines whether a fragment 'matches'
 * a given fragment.  Another operation finds all
 * sub-fragments (fragments contained within a
 * parent fragment, including the parent itself)
 * which 'match' another given fragment.
