<ul>
<li>
New Non-Java projects are now shown in the Package Explorer. Added a filter
to hide non-Java projects.</li>

<li>
Open Type Dialog no support the special end of type name character &lt;.
If you want to see all types that end with factory you have to use the
pattern *factory&lt;. If a pattern doesn't end with &lt; then a star is
automatically added to the pattern.</li>

<li>
The Project menu now contains two actions to quickly open the Generate
Javadoc and the Java Build Path dialog.</li>

<li>
The Java editor preference pages have been reworked. Java editor text hovers
are now fully user configurable.</li>

<li>
New <i>Push Down</i> refactoring. To use it, select set of non-static methods
and fields (declared in a class) and choose 'Push Down' from the menu.
You can then, for each of the class methods and fields choose if you want
to either</li>

<ul>
<li>
push it down to subclasses or</li>

<li>
(in the case of methods) push down to subclasses and declare abstract in
the class that currently declares the method or</li>

<li>
leave as is</li>
</ul>

<li>
Class file editor and compilation unit editor have been unified. Both are
supporting now: current line highlighting, line numbers, overview rulers,
bracket matching (painting + navigation), squiggly lines, print margin
indication, error navigation, goto previous and next member, and expand
to selection.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<i>Pull Up</i> refactoring is more powerful now. Additional functionality
includes:</li>

<ul>
<li>
You can add new members to pull up after the refactoring dialog appears.</li>

<li>
Members can be pulled up more than 1 level in the class hierarchy.</li>

<li>
Instead of pulling methods up you can choose to declare them abstract in
the destination class. Refactoring will then add method stubs to all non-abstract
subclasses of the destination class (only those that require such additions).</li>

<li>
By pressing 'Pull Up Required Members' you can compute the set of all members
that are required to be pulled up together with those already selected.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<i>Move</i> refactoring now supports updating qualified names in non Java
files as well.</li>

<h2>
What's new in this drop</h2>

<ul>
<li>
Added link-like navigation for declarations to Java editor. While the Control
key is pressed, text over which the mouse hovers and which have a declaration
turn into links which can be clicked. The link color can be changed on
the Java Editor Appearance Preference page.</li>

<li>
Applied patch submitted by Scott Rutledge to go into top level type in
Java outliner.</li>

<li>
Added new view menu option in the Package Explorer called "Layout" which
allows to switch between "Flat" and "Hierarchical" (default is flat). The
"Hierarchical" layout displays the package structure in a tree. There is
also a preference (Java -&gt; Appearance)</li>

<br>which allows to set if empty package fragments are folded together
when in hierarchical view (default is folded).
<li>
<i>Work in progress:</i> Java Editor hovers can now be configured per modifier
(Window -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Java -&gt; Editor -&gt; Hovers). The enable/disable
button in the workbench toolbar affects all configured hovers.</li>

<li>
Applied patch submitted by Sebastian Davids. It adds the new template variable
${year}.</li>

<li>
Added a new refactoring, Inline Constant. This refactoring operates on
multiple compilation files, and lets the user automatically replace references
to a static final field with expressions equivalent to the field's initializer
(provided the static final field is not blank). The action can be invoked
when a reference to, or declaration of, such a constant is selected, either
in the editor, or in an outline. The user can choose to only inline the
selected reference (if a reference is selected), inline all references
(anywhere in the workspace), or inline only some references, selecting
only the desired changes from the preview page. If all references are to
be replaced, the user can choose to have the constant declaration removed.
When the initializer expression refers to entities not visible from a particular
inline site, the initializer will be adapted to that inline site by qualifying
the names of some of the entities (by prepending multiple levels of enclosing
class names). If the initializer refers to non-static or non-final fields,
the user will be unobtrusively warned.</li>

<h2>
What's new in this drop</h2>

<ul>
<li>
Added new 'Promote Local Variable to Field' refactoring - to perform, select
a local variable in the editor and choose 'Promote Local Variable to Field'.
You can then select the field's visibility and other modifiers (if applicable).
If the variable is initialized on creation, then the refactoring allows
moving the initialization to the class' constructors or the new field's
declaration.</li>

<li>
Added new 'Convert Anonymous Class to Nested Class' refactoring - to perform,
select an anonymous class delcaration and choose 'Convert Anonymous to
Inner'. You can then choose a name and visibility for the new class. The
refactoring then also passes accessed local variables to the new class
via added constructor variables. This refactoring is useful for instance
when you realize that your inner class has grown too big to be anonymous.
Btw, you can then (if it ever grows even more or proves to be more generally
useful) move it to top level by using the 'Move Nested to Top Level' refactoring.</li>

<li>
Added new shortcut to Java Editor: "Open Declaration" can now be triggered
with Ctrl-Left Mouse Button as well.</li>

<li>
Added first batch of Mac OS X keybindings.</li>

<li>
A new icon is used for an empty package that contains resources.</li>

<li>
New property page on Java projects to define project specific compiler
settings.</li>

<li>
New UI to define special tasks tag. Task tags can be used in comments and
the compiler will generate a marker when detected. Example usage of a task
tag is 'TODO' to mark code that has to be revisited.</li>

<li>
Added name guessing for the Extract Constant refactoring.</li>

<li>
JUnit: added support to find and navigate to tests that reference a particular
type or method. The action is in "Navigate&gt;Go To&gt;Referring Tests".</li>
</ul>

Inline Method - new refactoring. To activate the refactoring, select a
method invocation in a compilation unit editor and select <i>Inline Method</i>
from the refactoring menu. Alternatively, select a method declaration in
the editor.</li>

<br>You can choose between inlining only the selected method call or inlining
all calls (in which case you can also delete the method).
<br>Note that currently no checking is done if method to be inlined is
reimplemented in subclasses.
<li>
Change Signature refactoring: Modify Parameters refactoring has been enhanced
to add and remove parameters. Also, the parameter types and the method
return type can be changed. The declaration of the method, declarations
of methods overriding/implementing it and all invocations are updated accordingly.</li>

<br>Currently, to change the method's name Rename refactoring should be
used. This will change in a future release - Change Signature will allow
renaming the method too.
<br>To activate - select a method or constructor and choose <i>Change Signature..</i>
from the <i>Refactor</i> menu.
<li>
Use Supertype Where Possible refactoring: new refactoring that replaces
usages of a type with one of its supertypes.</li>

<br>It computes the largest set of references that can be updated.
<br>To activate, select a type and choose <i>Use Supertype Where Possible...</i>.
<li>
Extract Constant refactoring: new refactoring to create a constant (a static
final field) out of a selected expression. To activate, select an expression
in the editor and choose <i>Extract Constant</i> from the context or global
<i>Refactor</i>
menu. You can replace all matching or only the selected expression.</li>

<li>
New Quick fixes</li>

<ul>
<li>
Fix usage of non visible methods/ fields, types and imports</li>

<li>
Fix access of instance variables in static contexts</li>

<li>
Fix for abstract methods in non-abstact types</li>

<li>
Fix type has unimplemented abstract methods</li>

<li>
Fix to add additional catch clauses for uncaught exceptions</li>
</ul>

<li>
New API class: <tt>IClasspathContainerPageExtension</tt>: Classpath container
pages that implement <tt>IClasspathContainerPage</tt> can optionally implement
<tt>IClasspathContainerPageExtension</tt>
to get additional information about the context when the page is opened.</li>

<li>
JUnit Plugin Tests (not part of the SDK, but available as an optional plugin).
The launching was changed to be more compatible with PDE. This avoids plugin
version conflicts and supports running tests with references to external
plug-ins (not all referenced plugins have to be available as binary projects).</li>
</ul>

to quickly navigate between methods, types, fields and initializers</li>

<br>The action is also available from the <i>Edit</i> menu
<li>
<b>Extract Interface</b> refactoring - creates a new interface with a set
of method and makes the selected class implement the interface.</li>

<br>Also, an option is provided to change references to the class into
references to the new interface (where possible).
<br>The refactoring can be activated by selecting a class and choosing
the appropriate entry from the context or global <i>Refactor</i> menu.
<li>
<b>Move Inner Class to Top Level</b> refactoring - select an inner class
and choose the appropriate action from</li>

<br>the context or or global <i>Refactor</i> menu. A new compilation unit
will be created and the inner class will be moved to that compilation unit.
<br>Where necessary, references will be updated. If the class is not static,
then a field is created to access the enclosing instance.</ul>
