- Serial version quick fix calculation now launches a separate VM
- there's now an Externalized String hover which shows the externalized
  value when hovering over an NLS key in the Java editor.
- pushed Quick Fix/Assist command down to org.eclipse.ui.ide, see <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=74675">bug 74675</a> for details.
- calls to reconcile a CU have been improved by only enabling the JDT UI's
  problem requestor when reconcile(...) is called by the Java reconciler, hence problems
  are now only reported to JDT UI's problem requestor when the Java reconciler calls
  reconcile(...). Note that clients requesting an AST when calling reconcile(...) will
  now get null or an empty AST due to bug <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=76738">76738</a>. Either use the ASTProvider to get the AST or enable
  (and disable later) the problem requestor.

- bug fixing
