========== Eclipse Build Input Junit 10th 2004 ==========<br>
<pre>
- in order to fix bug 63247, we have added a "Filters..." dialog to the view menu of
  the Java search results page. Besides the filters we had previously, the number of
  top level elements (or just elements when in the "flat" layout mode), can be limited
  to a given value. The default is to filter with a threshold value of 1000 top level 
  elements. 
</pre>
========== Eclipse Build Input May 25th 2004 ==========<br>
<pre>
- Javadoc view now uses style sheet /JavadocStyleSheet.css
- bug fixing
</pre>
========== Eclipse Build Input May 17th 2004 ==========<br>
<pre>
- added new Problem description hover. The Combined hover tries this one before
  the Javadoc hover and tries the Annotation description hover at the end
- improved cursor feedback when hovering over annotations in vertical ruler
- bug fixing
</pre>
========== Eclipse Build Input May 11th 2004 ==========<br>
<pre>
- reworked Java editor preference pages:
  - Annotations and Quick Diff sub-pages are gone: they are now centralized under
    Workbench > Editors
  - Hover preference page has been improved
  - several sub-pages are now separate pages under Java > Editor
  - merged Spelling preference sub-pages onto one page
  - added cursor feedback when hovering over annotations in vertical ruler
- removed Java editor related dependencies on compatibility plug-in
- externalized all strings
- bug fixing
- Semantic highlighting:
  - Class file editor support
  - Added highlightings: local/parameter variable reference, local variable declaration,
      static method invocation, abstract method invocation, inherited method invocation
  - Merged preference page with syntax highlighting page
- Italic text attribute support for syntax and semantic highlighting
- Case-insensitive task tag support in syntax highlighting
</pre>
========== Eclipse Build Input May 4th 2004 ==========<br>
<pre>
- Added new Folding preference page (Java > Editor) which allows to enable and
  configure folding for the Compilation Unit editor (support for the class file
  editor will follow)
- JDT UI defines the org.eclipse.jdt.ui.foldingStructureProvider extension
  point which allows arbitrary foldings to be contributed. The standard folding
  allows to fold methods, javadoc, inner types, and imports.
  - contributed structure providers must implement IJavaFoldingStructureProvider,
    which is responsible for keeping the folding model up to date when the document
    changes. Folding structure changes are reflected by updating the ProjectionAnnotationModel.
  - additionally, contributors may specify an IJavaFoldingPreferenceBlock that 
    will be displayed on the Java Editor preference page. User preferences for folding
    can be shown there.
</pre>
========== Eclipse Build Input April 27th 2004 ==========<br>
<pre>
- Added new Occurrences preference page (Java > Editor) which allows to control
  for which elements occurrences get marked (types, methods, constants, non-constant
  fields local variables and constants).
- Added a new tool bar button which allows to quickly toggle occurrence highlighting.
- Initial release of semantic highlighting
</pre>
========== Eclipse Build Input April 20th 2004 ==========<br>
<pre>

<pre>

  default override and implements icons will appear in the vertical ruler and allow
  to jump to the super implementation.
</pre>

- The Java editor's background reconciler now gets the AST from the Java Model
  and offers a reconcile listener to inform internal clients about the new AST.

  who use an AST should use ASTProvider.getAST(...) to get the AST.
- Rename and move refactorings also update references in javadoc tags.
- Simplified rename dialogs.
- Semantic change in RenameSupport (org.eclipse.jdt.ui.refactoring):
  The flags UPDATE_JAVADOC_COMMENTS, UPDATE_REGULAR_COMMENTS, and
  UPDATE_STRING_LITERALS are deprecated and replaced by UPDATE_TEXTUAL_MATCHES.
  When renaming java elements, references in javadocs are now updated iff
  UPDATE_REFERENCES is set. All textual matches are now updated iff 
  UPDATE_REGULAR_COMMENTS or UPDATE_STRING_LITERALS is set.

- Occurrences of the selected element can be highlighted in the Java editor
  (Java > Work in Progress > Mark occurrences in file). These Search annotations
  can be highlighted (see Annotation preference page) and also quickly removed
