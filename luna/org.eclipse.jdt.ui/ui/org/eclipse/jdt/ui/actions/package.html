     Application programming interfaces for Eclipse Java User Interface specific
  actions.     
<h2> Package Specification</h2>
     The package provides actions and action groups to populate tool bars,
 global  menu bars and context menus with JDT specific functionality.   
 
<p>It is recommended that clients use action groups to populate menus and
  tool bars instead of adding actions directly. </p>
<p>Clients are allowed to instantiate classes from this package. The classes are 
  not intended to be subclassed. All actions and groups require that the selection 
  provided by the site, view part or page passed to the action's or group's constructor 
  is of type <code>org.eclipse.jface.viewers.IStructuredSelection</code> .</p>
